# 🎉 EmoStream: Concurrent Emoji Broadcast over Event-Driven Architecture

## 📝 Project Overview

Emojis 😄 reflect the dynamic sentiments of fans in real-time. When Virat is batting 🏏, everyone’s hoping for boundaries with every ball; when he’s on the field, they’re cheering for wickets 🎯. Capturing these user-generated signals as they flow in, distilling them into an emoji swarm 🐝 that mirrors the crowd’s mood, and displaying these shifting emotions live is a major challenge—especially with billions of emoji reactions anticipated over the tournament 📊.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project was to design and implement a **scalable system** 🧱 that enhances the viewer experience on platforms like **Hotstar** 📺 by capturing and processing **billions of user-generated emojis** 💬 in real-time during live sporting events. This was achieved by creating a **horizontally scalable architecture** 🛠️ using **Kafka** 📨 for data streaming and **Spark** ⚡ for real-time data processing. The system ensures **high concurrency** and **low latency**, delivering seamless user interactions 🚀.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🔧 Key Components

1. **API Endpoint and Data Collection** 📥  
   - A Flask-based **API endpoint** was created to receive **POST** requests from users, containing the emoji data (User ID 👤, Emoji type 😊, Timestamp ⏱️).  
   - Each emoji data entry is **asynchronously** written to a Kafka producer ⚙️.
   
2. **Kafka Producer and Data Streaming** 🔄  
   - The emoji data is pushed to **Kafka** 📦 as a message queue, with a **flush interval** of 500 milliseconds ⏳ to ensure real-time data transmission to the Kafka broker.

3. **Real-Time Data Processing with Spark** 🔥  
   - A **Spark Streaming** job consumes the emoji data from Kafka in **micro-batches** 📊.  
   - The micro-batches are processed in intervals of 2 seconds ⌛, with an aggregation algorithm that reduces 1000 or fewer emojis of the same type to a single representative emoji 🎭.

4. **Pub-Sub Architecture for Scalability** 📣  
   - A **Publisher-Subscriber** model is implemented to handle **high concurrency** ⚡.  
   - Multiple **Kafka clusters** are established, each with its own **publisher** 📤 and multiple **subscribers** 📥.  
   - The main publisher receives aggregated data from Spark and forwards it to the cluster publishers.  
   - Subscribers handle the distribution of messages to clients, ensuring **real-time updates** 🧠 to users.

5. **Client Registration and Seamless Connection Management** 🔗  
   - Clients can register with the subscribers to receive real-time emoji updates 💬.  
   - The system supports **dynamic client registration** and **removal** 🔄, ensuring no interruptions in the live data flow 🛜.


- **API Endpoint**: A Flask API that accepts emoji data from users and sends it asynchronously to the Kafka producer 🧑‍💻.
- **Kafka Producer**: The producer writes emoji data to Kafka with a flush interval of 0.5 seconds ⏲️.
- **Spark Streaming Job**: A job that processes the emoji data in 2-second intervals, applying the aggregation logic to reduce emojis 🔁.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Architecture**: A robust architecture that scales to handle large numbers of clients with multiple clusters, each with a cluster publisher and several subscribers 🔄.
- **Real-Time Data Delivery**: The aggregated emoji data is delivered back to clients in real time, with seamless handling of client connections 📡.

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Tests were created for the API endpoints to ensure they could handle thousands of emoji requests per second 🔍.
- **Load Testing**: The system was stress-tested 🧱 to ensure it could handle high concurrency with thousands of concurrent clients sending emoji data 🔄.
- **Scalability Testing**: The Pub-Sub model was tested to ensure real-time data delivery to users, even under high load 🚦.

## 🎥 Demo

The system was demonstrated with multiple clients sending emoji data to the API endpoint 📤. Kafka producer asynchronously received and wrote emoji data to the Kafka broker 📦, and the Kafka consumer processed and aggregated the data using Spark Streaming 🔥. The aggregated data was then distributed to clients through the Pub-Sub architecture 📣, ensuring that all clients received **real-time emoji updates** ⏱️✨.
